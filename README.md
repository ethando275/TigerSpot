# TigerSpot

TigerSpot is an interactive geographical guessing web app. Users will be able to log in to their account, receive a daily photo of a place on campus, and place their guess of where they think it is on the map. After submitting a guess, the location will be revealed and their score will be determined based on how far their guess was to the correct location. Users can only play this mode once a day.
However, users can also play the Versus mode where users can compete one on one with their friends with five rounds per game. This is a great way for students to learn about new places on campus and interact more with the Princeton community!
